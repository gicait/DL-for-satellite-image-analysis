    "From this point onward, we will only deal with Neural Networks. In this section, let's try to develop simple neural networks (vanilla neural networks). Basically neural networks can be considered as universal function approximators. So, in this section, we will develop arbitrarily complicated functions going beyond simple linear and logistic functions, which we have done in the last section.\n",

    "So, we have data for 442 patients, 10 input variables and 1 output variable. And from now on, we will use a library call Tensorflow (Keras: high level, easy to use part of the Tensorflow library) which has lots of functions related to Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we used predefined equations (linear and logistic) to model the data. In case of Neural Networks, we can model arbitrarily complicated function as we prefer, with multiple layers, with multiple neurons in each layer, so on. So theoretically neural networks can be used to approximate any function with large enough number of neurons. There is a mathematical theorem proving this, and it is known as The Universal Approximation Theorem.\n",

    "Before that, we have to discuss little about activation functions. If we dig little deeper in to neural network architecture, each neuron can be considered as linear model. But the problem is, when we combine multiple neurons linearly, linear combinations of linear equations are also a linear function. So we are not adding any additional complexity to the model. To go around that, we are introducing activation functions (non-linearity) for each neurons. Most common and simplest activation function in known as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). More details about activation functions can be seen here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function\n",

The method / strategy of finding optimum parameter is called optimizer. In this case, we have chosen optimizer call __*Adam*__ which is a commonly used optimizer in practice. There are many optimizers available in Tensorflow library (have a look Tensorflow documentation for more details).\n",

These 2 parts of the whole dataset are called as Training and Test (or Validation) dataset. So let's do training and test splitting first and feed these data in to the model for fitting."
